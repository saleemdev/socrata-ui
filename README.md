# React | Vite | Ant Design | socrata-ui


- Ant Design has great pre-formatted components, it is easy to set up and is lightweight hence the intuitive UI

- My preference for Vite is because itis a lightweight bundler and ensures the app is fast.

- React-Query library is a convenient as a state manager because it handles fetching, caching and state management enhancing developer experience immensely

- Finally, ES6 features such as arrow functions, spread operator and template literals are essential for data processing and make the code much readable.
